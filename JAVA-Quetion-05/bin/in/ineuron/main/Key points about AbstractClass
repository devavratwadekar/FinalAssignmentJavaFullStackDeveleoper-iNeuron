Key Points about Abstract Classes:
==================================

1. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
2. It serves as a blueprint for derived classes to provide common functionality and define abstract methods.
3. Abstract methods are declared without implementation and must be overridden by the derived classes.
4. Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
5. Derived classes must provide implementations for all the abstract methods inherited from the abstract class.
