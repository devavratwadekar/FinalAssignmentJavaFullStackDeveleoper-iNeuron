Key Points about Interfaces:
============================

1. An interface defines a contract for classes to follow.
2. It contains abstract methods that must be implemented by classes that implement the interface.
3. Classes can implement multiple interfaces.
4. Interfaces cannot have instance variables but can have constants.
5. Interfaces can be used to achieve abstraction and provide a common interface for unrelated classes.
